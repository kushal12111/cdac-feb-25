Dry Run Steps:
Initialization:

count = 0

i = 0

First Iteration of the Loop (i = 0):

i++: Post-increment i (uses the current value before incrementing), so i is 0 but then becomes 1

Expression so far: count += 0 - ++i

++i: Pre-increment i (increments before using it), so i becomes 2

Expression so far: count += 0 - 2

count = count + (0 - 2) → count = 0 - 2 = -2

Increment i for next loop iteration: i becomes 3

Second Iteration of the Loop (i = 3):

i++: Post-increment i (uses the current value before incrementing), so i is 3 but then becomes 4

Expression so far: count += 3 - ++i

++i: Pre-increment i (increments before using it), so i becomes 5

Expression so far: count += 3 - 5

count = count + (3 - 5) → count = -2 + (-2) = -4

Increment i for next loop iteration: i becomes 6

Third Iteration of the Loop (i = 6):

The condition i < 4 is false (since i = 6), so the loop terminates.

Guessed Output:
The value of count after the loop completes is -4. Therefore, the output will be:

-4
