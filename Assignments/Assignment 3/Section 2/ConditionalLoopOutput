Dry Run Steps:
Initialization:

num = 1

First Iteration of the Loop (i = 1):

Condition i <= 4 is true

i % 2 == 0 is false (because 1 is odd)

num -= i → num = 1 - 1 = 0

Increment i to 2

Second Iteration of the Loop (i = 2):

Condition i <= 4 is true

i % 2 == 0 is true (because 2 is even)

num += i → num = 0 + 2 = 2

Increment i to 3

Third Iteration of the Loop (i = 3):

Condition i <= 4 is true

i % 2 == 0 is false (because 3 is odd)

num -= i → num = 2 - 3 = -1

Increment i to 4

Fourth Iteration of the Loop (i = 4):

Condition i <= 4 is true

i % 2 == 0 is true (because 4 is even)

num += i → num = -1 + 4 = 3

Increment i to 5 (loop terminates)

Guessed Output:
The value of num after the loop completes is 3. Therefore, the output will be:

3
