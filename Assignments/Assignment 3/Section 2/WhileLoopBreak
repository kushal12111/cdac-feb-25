Dry Run Steps:
Initialization:

count = 0

First Iteration of the Loop (count = 0):

Condition count < 5 is true

Print count: 0

Increment count: count = 1

Condition count == 3 is false

Second Iteration of the Loop (count = 1):

Condition count < 5 is true

Print count: 1

Increment count: count = 2

Condition count == 3 is false

Third Iteration of the Loop (count = 2):

Condition count < 5 is true

Print count: 2

Increment count: count = 3

Condition count == 3 is true

Break the loop

After the Loop:

Print count: 3

Guessed Output:
The output will be:

0 1 2 3
